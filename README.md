# Introduction
Test automation is the process of using automation tools to maintain test data, execute tests, and analyze test results to improve software quality. Automated testing is also called test automation or automated QA testing. When executed well, it relieves much of the manual requirements of the testing lifecycle.

In here we are going to test SWAG Labs (Sauce Demo - https://www.saucedemo.com). We are going to use tools and frameworks like Selenium, POM (Page Object Model) with Selenium with Java for the automation. This project focuses on automating tests for the Swag Labs website using Hybrid Framework of type Page Object Model. and Selenium.

# Scope
The project covers the following areas of the Swag Labs website:

<li>The Website provides various Usernames and Passwords For Login Page</li>
<li>Product page, including sorting features and product detailed view.</li>
<li>Add to cart page for all accepted users.</li>
<li>Checkout page for all accepted users.</li>

# Features
<li>Hybrid Framework of type Page Object Model(POM).</li>
<li>Uses Selenium for interacting with web elements and performing automated actions.</li>
<li>Organizes test scenarios for all modules Functionality.</li>
<li>Created  test cases covering login, products, cart functionality.</li>
<li>Provides easy-to-understand Testcases reports(Reporting Tool: Extent Reports) and test outcomes.</li>


# Tools and Technologies Used
This test automation project for Swag Labs utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to streamline the testing process and ensure efficient and accurate results.
<li>Java: The primary programming language used for writing the test automation code.</li>
<li>Frameworks implemented: Hybrid Framework of type Page Object Model.</li>
<li>Selenium: A popular open-source framework for automating web browser interactions and testing.</li>
<li>ChromeDriver: The WebDriver implementation for Google Chrome, enabling Selenium to automate Chrome   browser actions.</li>
<li>Reporting Tool: Extent Reports</li>
<li>TestNG: Testing framework for the Java programming language designed to simplify a broad range of testing <\t> needs, from unit testing to integration testing.</li>
<li>External data source to store test data: MS Excel using APACHE POI libraries. </li>
<li>Eclipse IDE: An integrated development environment for Java that provides a workspace for coding, testing, and debugging.</li>
<br>
These technologies are combined to create an effective testing framework that automates test cases, performs comparisons between expected and actual outcomes, and generates detailed test reports.


# Testing Approach
<li> Manual Testing </li>
     Manual testing will be conducted for functional testing, usability testing, and exploratory testing.

<li> Automated Testing </li>
     Automated testing tools will be used for regression testing, performance testing, and repetitive tasks.

#  Testing Tasks
</li> Functional Testing</li>
Verify user registration and login.
Test product selection and addition to the shopping cart.
Validate the checkout process.
Test user account management features.
Verify the search functionality.

</li>Non-functional Testing </li>
Conduct security testing to identify vulnerabilities.
Perform performance testing under various load conditions.
Ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.
Evaluate the website's usability.
